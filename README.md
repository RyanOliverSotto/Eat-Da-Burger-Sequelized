# Sequelized Burger Logger

### Overview
This application is a MVC "Keto Meal Planner" that utilizes MySQL, Sequelize, Node, Express, Handlebars, JAWS.  Node, MySQL, and Sequelize are used to query and route data into the app, and Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

### Purpose
This is a full CRUD application that allows you to enter meals you plan on eating, meals that you have already eaten, update meals, and remove them completely from the JAWS database.
